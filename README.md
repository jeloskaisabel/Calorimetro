# Calorimetro
Many experimental thermochemical laboratories require temperatures to be controlled during a reaction or physical procedure. Today, there are many alternatives to meet this requirement; however, they are expensive. In this work, we present a methodology for the construction of an easy calorimeter based on an Arduino data acquisition device for introductory chemical laboratories, we use an LM35 transistor as a temperature sensor connected to an Arduino UNO microcontroller for temperature detection and a gas pump. aquarium air to agitate the reaction system. In addition, the hardware required for implementation is explained in detail. The device was built using the DIY method. Full details of all components for the data acquisition construct are presented. We determine the heat capacity of the calorimeter and finally, we test the device to determine the exothermic heat of solution (Î”H) for NaOH in water.
